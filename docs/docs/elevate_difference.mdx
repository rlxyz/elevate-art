### Built to take the NFT industry forward

We have a philosophy at RLXYZ which is only to work on project that has the ability to push the Web3 space forward as a whole and with Elevate.Art, it's no different.

We aren't just building an generative art compiler to solve problems for today with minting capabilities. We are looking forward to the needs and requirements of artists, companies and Web3 communities and what products need to build to accomodate them.

With that in mind we believe the future will be all about collaboration, sharing and we need the tools that help us together create, launch and manage the multi-faceted relationships and collections that a spawned over the next few years.

### Used By The Best
