##### Sell an NFT in ETH to a specific buyer

---

The `Private Asks Module` allows anyone to sell an ERC-721 NFT to a specific `buyer` address. 
Meaning only the `buyer` address that is specified when the ask is created is allowed to fill it.
View all the module's contract code here [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ourzora/v3/blob/main/contracts/modules/Asks/Private/ETH/AsksPrivateEth.sol).

## Ask Structure
An `ask` can be created by an owner or approved operator for any ERC-721 token.
There can only be one `ask` open at a time for a given NFT.
`asks` can only be made in `ETH` for this module.


If an NFT is transferred to a new address the `ask` created by the previous address becomes invalid.
However, if the NFT were to be transferred back to the address that created the ask it would be valid again. 


* `seller`: Owner of the NFT
* `price`: Asking price for the sale in wei
* `buyer`: Address that is able to fill the ask

```
struct Ask {
    address seller;
    uint96 price;
    address buyer;
}
```

## Storage

#### askForNFT
A public mapping that returns an `ask` given an NFT token contract address and tokenId. 
Note that there can only ever be one `ask` open for an NFT at a time.

`mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => Ask)) public askForNFT`

- `createAsk` will overwrite if there was a previous open `ask`.
```
function createAsk(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _price,
    address _buyer
)
```

<br/>

### setAskPrice
Updates the information for a specific `ask`.
```
function setAskPrice(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _price
) 
```

<br/>

### cancelAsk
Cancels an `ask` for an NFT by either the owner or an approved operator.
```
function cancelAsk(address _tokenContract, uint256 _tokenId)
```

<br/>

### fillAsk 
Transfers the NFT to the buyer and sends the funds to the recipients. 
```
function fillAsk(address _tokenContract, uint256 _tokenId)
```
