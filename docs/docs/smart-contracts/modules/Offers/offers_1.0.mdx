##### Make an offer on any NFT

---

The `Offers Module` allows a user to create an `offer` on any ERC-721 token in either ETH or an ERC-20 token. 
You can view all of the `Offers V1.0 Module` contract code in this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ourzora/v3/blob/main/contracts/modules/Offers/V1/OffersV1.sol).

## Offer Structure

- `maker`: The address that created the `offer`
- `currency`: The address of the ERC-20 offered, or `address(0)` for ETH
- `findersFeeBps`: The fee to the referrer of the offer in basis points
- `amount`: The amount of ETH/ERC-20 tokens offered

```
struct Offer {
    address maker;
    address currency;
    uint16 findersFeeBps;
    uint256 amount;
}
```

#### Finders Fee

The Finders Fee is the amount offered to the party that helped match the buyer to the NFT.
For example, a user fills an `offer` for an NFT they would like to purchase. 
If a finders fee was specified, then the interface that helped match the NFT to the buyer could be entitled to that amount.
Note that the Finders Fee is only charged if a buyer fills the `offer` on an NFT.

## Storage

#### offers
Returns the metadata for an `offer`. <br/>
`ERC-721 Token Address => ERC-721 tokenID => offerID => Offer`
```
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => Offer))) public offers
```

<br/>

#### offersForNFT
Returns an array of `offerIds` for a specific ERC-721 token. <br/>
`ERC-721 tokenAddress => ERC-721 tokenID => Offer IDs` 
```
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256[])) public offersForNFT
```

---

## Functions

### createOffer
Creates an `offer` for a specific NFT which can be made in either ETH or an ERC-20 token and returns the `offerId` of the newly created `offer`.

- ZORA takes custody of the amount until either the `offer` is filled or canceled
- The user must first approve the [ERC-20 Transfer Helper](../../../../smart-contracts/zora-v3#approving-tokens-to-v3) if the `offer` currency is an ERC-20 token
- No approvals are needed if the `offer` currency is ETH

```
function createOffer(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    address _currency, //ERC-20 token address or address(0) for ETH
    uint256 _amount,
    uint16 _findersFeeBps
) returns (uint256)
```

<br/>

### fillOffer
Fills a given offer for an owned NFT, in exchange for ETH/ERC-20 tokens.

- `finder`: The address of the party that helped match the offer to the buyer
- The `finder` can be set to `address(0)` if no address is known

```
function fillOffer(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _offerId,
    address _currency,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _finder
)
```

<br/>

### setOfferAmount
Updates either the price, currency, or both for a given `offer`. 

- Increasing the amount requires that the user provide more collateral
- Decreasing the amount will refund the difference back to the `offer` maker address
- Updating the currency to an ERC-20 will require that the user approve the ERC-20 Transfer Helper if they haven't already approved that token.
```
function setOfferAmount(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _offerId,
    address _currency,
    uint256 _amount
)
```

<br/>

### cancelOffer
Cancels and refunds the given `offer`.
```
function cancelOffer(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _offerId
)
```
