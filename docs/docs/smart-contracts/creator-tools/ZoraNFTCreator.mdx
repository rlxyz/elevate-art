##### A factory that deploys new NFT contracts
---

This contract is in charge of deploying new NFT contracts. 
The factory references an `implementation` contract and clones it to give it it's own unique address.

View the contract code [here](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-drops-contracts/blob/main/src/ZoraNFTCreatorV1.sol) and the list of deployed addresses [here](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-drops-contracts/tree/main/deployments).

## Edition vs Drop 
This contract can be used to create either `Editions` or `Drops`.

- `Editions`: All the NFTs share the same media asset.
- `Drops`: All the NFTs have indiviual pieces of media.


## Global Variables

- `implementation`: An NFT contract used for cloning.
- `editionMetadataRenderer`: A contract for rendering editions metadata.
- `dropMetadataRenderer`: A contract for rendering drops.

## Creating an NFT Contract

### createEdition
Creates a new edition contract with a deterministic address.
Note, not all of these fields can be changed after creating the contract.

- `name`: Name of the edition contract (cannot be changed)
- `symbol`: Symbol of the edition contract (cannot be changed)
- `defaultAdmin`: Default admin address (contract sets the owner to this address by default)
- `editionSize`: Total size of the edition (number of possible editions)
- `royaltyBPS`: BPS amount of royalty (cannot be changed)
- `fundsRecipient`: Recipient for sales and royalties
- `description`: Metadata: Description of the edition entry
- `animationURI`: Metadata: Animation url (optional) of the edition entry
- `imageURI`: Metadata: Image url (semi-required) of the edition entry

```
function createEdition(
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    uint64 editionSize,
    uint16 royaltyBPS,
    address payable fundsRecipient,
    address defaultAdmin,
    IERC721Drop.SalesConfiguration memory saleConfig,
    string memory description,
    string memory animationURI,
    string memory imageURI
) external returns (address)
```

### createDrop
Creates a new drop contract with a deterministic address.
Note, not all of these fields can be changed after creating the contract.
- `name`: Name for new contract (cannot be changed)
- `symbol`: Symbol for new contract (cannot be changed)
- `defaultAdmin`: Default admin address (contract sets the owner to this address by default)
- `editionSize`: The max size of the media contract allowed
- `royaltyBPS`: BPS for on-chain royalties (cannot be changed)
- `fundsRecipient`: Recipient for sales and royalties
- `metadataURIBase`: URI Base for metadata
- `metadataContractURI`: URI for contract metadata

```
function createDrop(
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    address defaultAdmin,
    uint64 editionSize,
    uint16 royaltyBPS,
    address payable fundsRecipient,
    IERC721Drop.SalesConfiguration memory saleConfig,
    string memory metadataURIBase,
    string memory metadataContractURI
) external returns (address)
```
