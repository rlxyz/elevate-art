# Traits

---

The Layers section of the Generator is where you will find all the traits that are currently in your project. You can add new traits, delete traits and edit properties of traits within those layers. 

### Adding a Trait
Adding a Trait Image is as simple as dragging and dropping your images from your computer into the Layer that you'd like to add them to. 

The Generator is quite smart so if you add a Trait Image and it has the same file name but a different image it will replace the image. Likewise, if you add a Trait Image and it has the same image but a different filename it will rename the existing image. If you add a Trait Image and it has the same file name and the same image it will do nothing.

### Deleting a Trait
Deleting a Trait Image is as simple as clicking the "Trash Can" button in the Traits section of the Generator. This will delete the currently selected Trait Image from your project.

### Editing Trait Properties
You can edit the name of the existing Trait Image by clicking on the Pencil button in the Traits section of the Generator. This will open the Trait Properties window where you can edit the name of the Trait Image.
