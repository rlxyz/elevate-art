import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

Get started building with the Zora Development Kit (ZDK)

---
The ZDK makes it easy to access the Zora API without having to know GraphQL.

Check out the [ZDK intro guide](../guides/zdk-intro-guide) to see it in action.

:::note
It is possible to make up to `30` requests per minute without needing an API Key.
Please reach out to [@ZORAEngineering](https://twitter.com/ZORAEngineering) on Twitter if would like to request a key.

The max response size for all requests is **200** except for `zdk.search` which is capped at a max size of **50**.

[NFT Hooks](../developer-tools/nft-hooks/intro) is a tool that makes it even easier to fetch NFT data than the ZDK.

### Installing
View the source code for the ZDK: [GH Repository](https://github.com/ourzora/zdk)

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @zoralabs/zdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @zoralabs/zdk --save
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Instantiating
```js
import { ZDK, ZDKNetwork, ZDKChain } from "@zoralabs/zdk";

const networkInfo = {
    network: ZDKNetwork.Ethereum,
    chain: ZDKChain.Mainnet,
  }

const API_ENDPOINT = "https://api.zora.co/graphql";
const args = { 
              endPoint:API_ENDPOINT, 
              networks:[networkInfo], 
              apiKey: process.env.API_KEY 
            } 

const zdk = new ZDK(args) // All arguments are optional
```

#### API Key (Optional)
The API has a limit of 30 requests per minute without an API key. 
If more than 30 requests per minute are necessary then an API is required.

Direct message [@ZORAEngineering](https://twitter.com/ZORAEngineering) on Twitter for an API Key.

#### Network Details (Optional)
The API currently only supports and defaults to Ethereum Mainnet, 
but once other chains are available it will be possible to query specific networks by passing an array of different network options.
