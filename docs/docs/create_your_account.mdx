# Create Your Team

##### Connecting Your Wallet and Creating a Team
---
### Connecting Your Wallet
Creating an *Elevate* account is super simple!

To Sign up (and sign in) to *Elevate* go to [Elevate.Art](https://elevate.art) and click **â€˜Connectâ€™** in the top right hand corner. 

*Elevate* connects directly to your Ethereum wallet for authentication. 

:::note
For Web3 it is standard practice to â€˜*sign inâ€™* using your wallet as the primary authentication method for privacy as well as security. See â€˜FAQâ€™ for more info.

:::

You can use a MetaMask (recommended), Coinbase, Rainbow or WalletConnect supported wallet to log in. Click on your wallet of choice, then follow the prompts in the modal to connect your wallet to *Elevate.*

:::note
The transaction that pops up to â€˜*sign* inâ€™ is a *gasless* (i.e. free) transaction which means you do not need any ETH in your wallet to complete this transaction. The *signing* transaction is like a username/password log in that is there to confirm that you are the owner of that wallet.

:::

If you experience trouble logging in, double check to make sure youâ€™ve downloaded any browser extensions required to connect, and if you have a popup blocker, make sure it is disabled for *elevate.art.*


### Create Your Team

Once you have logged in, you will need to claim your *organisation* name and create a *project*.

**Organisation** 

The *organisation* name is your public facing profile page on *[elevate.art](http://elevate.art)* which people will use when it comes time to mint. You will be able to see it here on the URL slug: 

- [elevate.art/**organisation**/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)collection/

**Project**

The *project* name is your public facing name of the generative collection you are creating on *[elevate.art](http://elevate.art)* which comes after the *organisation* slug:

- [elevate.art/organisation/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)**project**/

**Examples**

Depending on what kind of creator or organisation you here are a few examples of the best ways to structure your *organisation* and *project* naming for future expansion.

**Artist**

This is an example of how XCOPY might structure thee profile for their 2 generative collections:

- [elevate.art/xcopy/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)grifters/
- [elevate.art/xcopy/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)max-pain/

This is an example of how Matt DesLauriers might structure the profile for his 3 generative collections:

- [elevate.art/mattdesl/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)subscapes/
- [elevate.art/mattdesl/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)meridians/
- [elevate.art/mattdesl/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)folio/

**Organisation**

This is an example of how Yuga Labs (founders of the Bored Ape Yacht Club) might structure their profile for their 3 generative collections:

- [elevate.art/yugalabs/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)bored-ape-yacht-club/
- [elevate.art/yugalabs/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)mutant-ape-yacht-club/
- [elevate.art/yugalabs/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)bored-ape-kennel-club/

This is an example of how PROOF Holdings (founders of Moonbirds) might structure their profile for their multiple generative collections:

- [elevate.art/proof/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)moonbirds/
- [elevate.art/proof/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)oddities/
- [elevate.art/proof/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)mythics/
- [elevate.art/proof/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)grails-1/
- [elevate.art/proof/](http://elevate.art/organisation/repository)grails-2/

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ For a design agency which is collaborating with a organisation or Web3 community to create their collection we recommend practicing good security hygiene and use the organisation structure above and use different wallets to log in to separate and contain any possible security breaches.
