##### Connecting Your Wallet to Create Your Team and Project

### Connecting Your Wallet
Creating an *Elevate* account is super simple!

To Sign up (and sign in) to *Elevate* go to [Elevate.Art](https://elevate.art) and click **‘Connect’** in the top right hand corner. 

*Elevate* connects directly to your Ethereum wallet for authentication. 

:::note
For Web3 it is standard practice to ‘*sign in’* using your wallet as the primary authentication method for privacy as well as security. See ‘FAQ’ for more info.

:::

You can use a MetaMask (recommended), Coinbase, Rainbow or WalletConnect supported wallet to log in. Click on your wallet of choice, then follow the prompts in the modal to connect your wallet to *Elevate.* 

![Wallet Login](../static/img/wallet-login.png)

:::note
The transaction that pops up to ‘*sign* in’ is a *gasless* (i.e. free) transaction which means you do not need any ETH in your wallet to complete this transaction. The *signing* transaction is like a username/password log in that is there to confirm that you are the owner of that wallet.

:::

If you experience trouble logging in, double check to make sure you’ve downloaded any browser extensions required to connect, and if you have a popup blocker, make sure it is disabled for *elevate.art.*

### Create Your Team

Once you have logged in, you will be able to claim your *Team* name and create a *Project*.

**Team** 

The *Team* name is your public facing profile page on *[elevate.art](http://elevate.art)* which people will use when it comes time to mint. You will be able to see it here on the URL slug: 

- elevate.art/**team**/project/

**Examples**

Depending on what kind of creator or organisation you are, here a few examples of the best ways to structure your *team* naming convention.

**Artist**

This is an example of how artists XCOPY and Matt DesLauriers should name their team if they are working as a singular artist:

- elevate.art/xcopy/
- elevate.art/mattdesl/

**Organisations**
This is an example of how PROOF Holdings (founders of Moonbirds) or Yuga Labs (founders of Bored Ape Yacht Club) should name their respective teams "proof" and "yugalabs":

- elevate.art/proof/
- elevate.art/yugalabs/

:::note
For a design agency which is collaborating with multiple organisations or Web3 communities to create their generative collection we recommend creating a new *Team* for each organisation or community you are working with.

### Create Your Project

Once you have claimed your *Team* name, you will be able to create a *Project*.

The *Project* name is the public facing name of the generative collection you are creating on *Elevate* which comes after the *Team* slug:

- elevate.art/organisation/**project**/

**Examples**

Depending on what kind of creator or organisation you here are a few examples of the best ways to structure your *Team* and *Project* naming for future expansion.

**Artist**

This is an example of how XCOPY should name his 2 generative projects (Grifters and Max Pain):

- elevate.art/xcopy/grifters/
- elevate.art/xcopy/max-pain/

This is an example of how Matt DesLauriers should name his 3 generative collections (Subscapes, Meridians and Folio):

- elevate.art/mattdesl/subscapes/
- elevate.art/mattdesl/meridians/
- elevate.art/mattdesl/folio/

**Organisations**

This is an example of how Yuga Labs should name their 3 generative projects (Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Bored Ape Kennel Club):

- elevate.art/yugalabs/bored-ape-yacht-club/
- elevate.art/yugalabs/mutant-ape-yacht-club/
- elevate.art/yugalabs/bored-ape-kennel-club/

This is an example of how PROOF Holdings should name their multiple generative projects:

- elevate.art/proof/moonbirds/
- elevate.art/proof/oddities/
- elevate.art/proof/mythics/
- elevate.art/proof/grails-1/
- elevate.art/proof/grails-2/
