##### Creator contracts make it easy to deploy and sell an NFT collection

---

These contracts allow anyone to deploy an NFT collection in seconds.
The `ZoraNFTCreator` factory contract uses [ERC721A](https://www.azuki.com/erc721a). 
ERC721A is a gas-optimized NFT contract that excels when trying to mint many NFTs in a single transaction.

In addition, these contracts **provide built-in sales mechanics**, making it easy to both deploy a collection and sell the initial mints.

## Addresses
Creator contract addresses are constantly changing due to new deployments. 
As a result, view [here for the most up-to-date addresses.](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-drops-contracts/tree/main/deployments)

###  Create Proxy Deployments
The create proxy is the main contract that is used to interact with the latest deployments of the create contracts. 

| **Network**       | **Address**                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|

## Main Create Contracts
The most important contracts are:

- [ZoraNFTCreator](./ZoraNFTCreator) - A factory that deploys new NFT contracts.
- [ERC721Drop](./ERC721Drop) - A template NFT contract that is used to create a new collection.
- [EditionMetadataRenderer](./EditionMetadataRenderer) - Renders metadata for an Edition NFT.
- [DropMetadataRenderer](./DropMetadataRenderer) - Renders metadata for a Drop NFT.

## Edition vs Drop

These contracts can make two different types of NFT collections:

- `Edition`: All the NFTs share the same media asset.
- `Drop`: All the NFTs have individual pieces of media.
