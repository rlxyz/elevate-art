## Auction Structure

- `seller`: The address of the seller
- `reservePrice`: The reserve price to start the auction
- `sellerFundsRecipient`: The address where funds are sent after the auction
- `highestBid`: The highest bid of the auction
- `highestBidder`: The address of the highest bidder
- `duration`: The length of time that the auction runs after the first bid is placed
- `startTime`: The time that the first bid can be placed
- `firstBidTime`: The time that the first bid is placed
- `currency`: The address of the ERC-20 token, or `address(0)` for ETH, required for a bid

```
struct Auction {
    address seller;
    uint96 reservePrice;
    address sellerFundsRecipient;
    uint96 highestBid;
    address highestBidder;
    uint48 duration;
    uint48 startTime;
    uint96 firstBidTime;
    address currency;
}

## Functions

### supportsInterface
Implements [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) for standard interface detection.

```
function supportsInterface(bytes4 _interfaceId) returns (bool)
```

<br/>

### createAuction
Creates an auction for a given ERC-721 NFT. There can only be one auction at a time for an NFT.

```
function createAuction(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _duration,
    uint256 _reservePrice,
    address _sellerFundsRecipient,
    uint256 _startTime,
    address _bidCurrency
) 
```

<br/>


### setAuctionReservePrice
Updates the auction reserve price for a given NFT

```
function setAuctionReservePrice(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _reservePrice
)
```

<br/>

### cancelAuction 
Cancels the auction for a given NFT.

```
function cancelAuction(address _tokenContract, uint256 _tokenId)
```

<br/>

### createBid
Places a bid on the auction for a given NFT. 
The bid percentage difference must be greater than or equal to 10% of the previous bid.

```
function createBid(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _amount
)
```

<br/>

### settleAuction
Ends the auction for a given NFT by sending the NFT to the highest bidder and the funds to the seller. 
Note, this module honors royalty payouts.
```
function settleAuction(address _tokenContract, uint256 _tokenId)
```
