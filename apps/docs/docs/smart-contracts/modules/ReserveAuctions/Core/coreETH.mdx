- `sellerFundsRecipient`: The address where funds are sent after the auction
- `highestBid`: The highest bid of the auction
- `highestBidder`: The address of the highest bidder
- `duration`: The length of time that the auction runs after the first bid is placed
- `startTime`: The time that the first bid can be placed
- `firstBidTime`: The time that the first bid is placed

```
struct Auction {
    address seller;
    uint96 reservePrice;
    address sellerFundsRecipient;
    uint96 highestBid;
    address highestBidder;
    uint32 duration;
    uint32 startTime;
    uint32 firstBidTime;
}
