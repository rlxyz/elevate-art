## Ask Structure

- `seller`: The address of the seller
- `price`: The price to fill the ask in wei

```
struct Ask {
    address seller;
    uint96 price;
}
```

---

## Storage

#### askForNFT
Returns an `ask` for a given NFT, if one exists <br/>
`ERC-721 tokenAddress => ERC-721 tokenId => Ask`

 ```
 mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => Ask)) public askForNFT
 ```

---

## Functions

### supportsInterface
Implements [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) for standard interface detection.

```
function supportsInterface(bytes4 _interfaceId) returns (bool)
```

<br/> 

### createAsk
Creates an ask for a specific ERC-721 NFT. 
Either the current owner or an approved operator can call this function.

Note that creating an `ask` for an ERC-721 token requires that the owner has previously approved the [ERC-721 Transfer Helper](../../../smart-contracts/zora-v3#approving-tokens-to-v3) for it to be valid.

```
function createAsk(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _price
)
```

<br/> 

### fillAsk
Fills the ask for a specific NFT if enough ETH is provided.
```
function fillAsk(address _tokenContract, uint256 _tokenId)
```

<br/> 

### setAskPrice 
Updates the ask price for a specfic NFT. Only the current owner is able to call this function.

```
function setAskPrice(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _price
)
```

<br/> 

### cancelAsk
Cancels the ask for a specific NFT. Either the current owner or an approved operator can call this function.

```
function cancelAsk(address _tokenContract, uint256 _tokenId)
```

    uint256 indexed tokenId, 
    address seller, 
    uint256 price
);
```

<br/>

AskCanceled(
    address indexed tokenContract, 
    uint256 indexed tokenId,
