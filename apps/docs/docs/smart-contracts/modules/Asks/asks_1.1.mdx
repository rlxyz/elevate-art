##### Sell an NFT at a specific asking price

---
The `Asks Module` allows anyone to sell an ERC-721 NFT for a specific asking price. 
You can view all of the `Ask V1.1 Module` contract code in this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ourzora/v3/blob/main/contracts/modules/Asks/V1.1/AsksV1_1.sol).

## Ask Structure
An `ask` can be created by an owner or approved operator for any ERC-721 token.
There can only be one `ask` open at a time for a given NFT.
If an NFT is transferred to a new address the `ask` created by the previous address becomes invalid.
However, if the NFT were to be transferred back to the address that created the ask it would be valid again. 


* `seller`: The owner or approved address for an NFT
* `sellerFundsRecipient`: The address to send funds to once the NFT is sold
* `askCurrency`: ERC-20 token to accept, or address(0) for ETH
* `findersFeeBps`: The bps of the sale amount to be sent to the referrer of the sale
* `askPrice`: The sale price

```
struct Ask {
  address seller;
  address sellerFundsRecipient; 
  address askCurrency;
  uint16 findersFeeBps;
  uint256 askPrice;
}
```

<br/> 

### Finders Fee

The Finders Fee is the amount offered to the party that helped match the buyer to the NFT.
For example, a user creates an `ask` for one of the NFTs in their wallet. 
If a finders fee was specified, then the interface that helped match the NFT to the buyer could be entitled to that amount.
Note that the Finders Fee is only charged if a buyer fills the `ask` on an NFT.

<br/> 

### Honoring Royalties
Whenever an `ask` is filled, the `Ask V1 Module` respects any royalties in this [Royalty Registry](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/lookup) created by Manifold.
If your NFT contract doesn't currently support royalties, the owner address of an NFT contract is able to manually set the royalty in the registry.

To calculate the percentage of a Royalty you can call `getRoyaltyView` on the Royalty engine with the token contract address, token id, and a value of 1e18 (1 ETH in wei) to get the splits and calculate the percentages based on the response.

## Storage

#### askForNFT
A public mapping that returns an `ask` given an NFT token contract address and tokenId. 
Note that there can only ever be one `ask` open for an NFT at a time.

`mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => Ask)) public askForNFT`

## Functions

### createAsk 
Puts an NFT up for sale at a specific asking price. 
- Can be created by either the owner or approved operator of an NFT.
- The `ask` currency can be any ERC-20 token or the `address(0)` for ETH.
- `createAsk` will overwrite if there was a previous open `ask`.
```
function createAsk(
  address _tokenContract,
  uint256 _tokenId,
  uint256 _askPrice,
  address _askCurrency,
  address _sellerFundsRecipient,
  uint16 _findersFeeBps
)
```

<br/>

### setAskPrice
Updates the information for a specific `ask`.
```
function setAskPrice(
  address _tokenContract,
  uint256 _tokenId,
  uint256 _askPrice,
  address _askCurrency
) 
```

<br/>

### cancelAsk
Cancels an `ask` for an NFT by either the owner or an approved operator.
```
function cancelAsk(address _tokenContract, uint256 _tokenId)
```

<br/>

### fillAsk 
Transfers the NFT to the buyer and sends the funds to the recipients. 
If no `finder` address is provided or no Finders Fee is set, then you can submit the `finder` as the `0 address` which will send all the funds to the seller.
```
function fillAsk(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    address _fillCurrency,
    uint256 _fillAmount,
    address _finder
) 
```
