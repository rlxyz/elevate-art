##### Build a permissionless Auction House with the ZORA protocol

---

ZORA has created a [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ourzora/create-auction-house) that makes it easy for anyone to launch their own auction house.
Compatible with any ERC-721 token contract, quickly list and sell NFTs using the ZORA Auction House smart contract.

## Getting Started

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn create next-app project-name -e https://github.com/ourzora/create-auction-house
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npx create-next-app project-name -e https://github.com/ourzora/create-auction-house
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The application accepts the below environment variables. You will need to specify the network ID along with either a `Curator Address` or a `Contract Address`.
Once you have created your repo locally, make sure to install all dependencies by running yarn.

Next, modify the values below in the .env file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TITLE=[default app title]

NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION=[default meta description]

NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=[production-url]

# NETWORK ID: Ethereum Mainnet(1) Rinkeby Testnet(4)

NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ID=1

NEXT_PUBLIC_CURATORS_ID=[The address of a curator or NFT creator]

NEXT_PUBLIC_TARGET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=[the address of the NFT contract]
```

Run `yarn dev` to run the development server locally at `localhost:3000`

## Going Live

The easiest way to deploy your auction house is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/).
Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details. Don't forget to update the necessary environment variables.
