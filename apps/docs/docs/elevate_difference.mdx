# What Makes Elevate Art Different?

---

### Philosophy

Elevate Art is a product created by a Web3 native venture studio called RLXYZ which has launched multiple sell-out generative NFT collections with leading international companies and artists.

We have exacting standards to only work on projects that have the ability to push the Web3 space forward as a whole with creators sovereign ownership at the heart of it.

With that in mind we believe the future will be all about collaboration, sharing and we need the tools that help us together create, launch and manage the multi-faceted relationships and collections that a Web3 teams need long-term.

### Used By The Best

We've had the privelege of working with some of the best companies, artists and Web3 communities in our time in this space. It's with immense pride that we can say that we are working with a Top 5 Web3 community to help launch their next collection using our platform.

### Team

Our team is fully doxxed (a known team...of real people) from leading companies in the tech, design and marketing space with years of experience in Web3.

We have experience on both sides of the fence not just as collectors but as contributors and founders of NFT projects.

This experience gives us a clear view on the needs, requirements and challenges of Web3 teams working across timezones and multiple platforms and we are building Elevate Art to simplify the entire collaborative experience.

### Onchain & Off-Chain

We are passionate advocates for more On-Chain Art Generation and we have launched multiple On-Chain Generative Photography collections to bring more 'On Chain Purity' to the photography genre using this technology.

We like On-Chain Art Generation for a number of reasons:

- it provides greater assurances of ownership and transparency to the collector
- there is more serendipity at mint in the overall collection where the randomness of the On-Chain Art Generation is not controlled by the artist, therefore there is increased skill and curation required by the artist

To help promote this philosophy of more On-Chain Art Generation we are providing that technology for creators to be able to use it for their projects to create more serendipity in the creation of the art.

We also provide the ability for creators to curate and export their final collection 'Off-Chain' for more control on what the final collection will look like after mint.

### Smart Contracts built by the Best

We are fans of the open marketplace philosophy and therefore we allow creators to choose from the best open source smart contracts to suit their use case.

These open source smart contracts have been used to deploy countless NFT projects safely, efficiently and with low gas fees.
