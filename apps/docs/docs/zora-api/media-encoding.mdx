# Media Encoding

##### Understand the different media formats that can be retrieved

All images and videos have been encoded to enable a range of sizes to choose from.
This makes it easy to show a preview or thumbnail without having to show the original size.

## Images & GIFs

The following encoding types are supported for images/GIFs:
- `THUMBNAIL`
    - Converts file to `.webp`
    - Max size of 240px
- `POSTER`
    - Converts file to `.jpeg`
    - Max size of 602px
- `LARGE`
    - Converts file to `.webp`
    - Max size of 8192px
- `ORIGINAL`
    - Does not apply any encoding (except if the image exceeds `LARGE` width and height, then the `LARGE` max size is applied)
