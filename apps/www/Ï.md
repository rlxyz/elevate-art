## Creating Google Service Accounts

1. Refer to [this](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#iam-service-account-keys-create-console) guide to create the Google Service Account.
2. Create a new key for the service account and download the JSON file based on this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?walkthrough_id=iam--create-service-account-keys&start_index=1&_ga=2.178944484.1377933432.1673834605-832100739.1673834605#step_index=1).

# Environments

## Google Cloud Storage (GCP)

### Localhost

This [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?walkthrough_id=iam--create-service-account-keys&project=elevate-apps-www-staging&supportedpurview=project) provides all the information about the service account.

1. Project ID = "elevate-apps-www-localhost"
2. Service Account Name = "storage-service-owner"
3. Service Account Roles = Storage Object Owner, Storage Object Viewer, Storage Object Admin
4. Service Account Email = "storage-service-owner@elevate-apps-www-localhost.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

We recommend to use this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/details/103691944182436621216/keys?walkthrough_id=iam--create-service-account-keys&project=elevate-apps-www-staging&supportedpurview=project) to manage the service account keys.

For the buckets, we have two uniquely named buckets as per the `AssetDeploymentBranch` enum variables from prisma.

1. `Production` - elevate-asset-deployment-production-localhost
2. `Preview` - elevate-asset-deployment-preview-localhost

### Staging

This [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?walkthrough_id=iam--create-service-account-keys&project=elevate-apps-www-staging&supportedpurview=project) provides all the information about the service account.

1. Project ID = "elevate-apps-www-staging"
2. Service Account Name = "storage-service-owner"
3. Service Account Roles = Storage Object Owner, Storage Object Viewer, Storage Object Admin
4. Service Account Email = "storage-service-owner@elevate-apps-www-staging.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

We recommend to use this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/details/103691944182436621216/keys?walkthrough_id=iam--create-service-account-keys&project=elevate-apps-www-staging&supportedpurview=project) to manage the service account keys.

1. `Production` - elevate-asset-deployment-production-staging
2. `Preview` - elevate-asset-deployment-preview-staging

One would also need to ensure that the `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` have the `Storage Object Viewer` role for the bucket.

### Production

This [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?walkthrough_id=iam--create-service-account-keys&project=elevate-apps-www-staging&supportedpurview=project) provides all the information about the service account.

1. Project ID = "elevate-apps-www-main"
2. Service Account Name = "storage-service-owner"
3. Service Account Roles = Storage Object Owner, Storage Object Viewer, Storage Object Admin
4. Service Account Email = "storage-service-owner@elevate-apps-www-main.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
